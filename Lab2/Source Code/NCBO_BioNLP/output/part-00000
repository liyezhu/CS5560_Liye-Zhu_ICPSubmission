30176275|t|Subgroup Survival Analysis In Stage I-II NSCLC Patients With a Central Tumor Partly Treated With Risk-Adapted SBRT.
30176275|a|PURPOSE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been associated with increased toxicity when delivered to early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with a tumor within 2cm of the proximal bronchial tree (PBT). We investigated non-cancer death for these patients as it relates to GTV-proximity to the PBT compared to peripheral tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We included 765 early stage NSCLC patients treated with SBRT to a median of 3x18Gy. Patients with central tumors were treated with a risk-adapted (less intense) schedule (mostly 8 fractions) in 55% of the patients in the first cm group, and 27% of the patients in the second cm group. An average anatomy with PBT and organs at risk (OARs) contoured was deformed onto each patient to obtain distance of the GTV to the PBT and doses to OARs. Log-rank, one-way Anova and Cox regressions were performed to assess differences between the first cm, second cm and peripheral groups, and associations with non-cancer death. RESULTS: Median overall survival was 42.7 months, median non-cancer death was 57.3 months and median follow-up 34.8 months. Non-cancer death in the first cm group (31 patients) was significantly different from non-cancer death in the other groups with hazard ratio (HR) 3.175 (p<0.001). Non-cancer death in the second cm group (71 patients) was not different from non-cancer death in the peripheral group (p=0.53). Doses to OARs were higher in the first and second cm groups than the peripheral group for all OARs. High dose to the PBT was associated with non-cancer death: D1%, HR:1.006Gy-1 (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Patients with a GTV in the first cm surrounding the PBT died more often from other causes than cancer. Non-cancer death in patients with a GTV in the second cm, who partly received a risk-adapted schedule, was comparable to patients with a peripheral tumor.
30173656|t|The effect of melatonin on Superoxide dismutase and Glutathione peroxidase activity, and Malondialdehyde levels in the targeted and the non-targeted lung and heart tissues after irradiation in xenograft mice colon cancer.
30173656|a|PURPOSE: Radiation causes damage to irradiated tissues and also tissues that do not receive direct irradiation through a phenomenon called bystander effects. Melatonin as a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent is known for protection of normal tissues against ionizing irradiation. In addition, some studies have suggested that Melatonin may have some anti-cancer properties. Although the complete mechanisms remain unknown, it can act via immunomodulatory effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pretreatment with melatonin on oxidative damage caused by direct irradiation and bystander effects on the lung and heart tissue after xenograft mice colon cancer irradiation in Balb/c mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty nine (49) Balb/c mice were evenly divided into 7 groups including control, irradiation of 5 Gy directly to tumor, melatonin treatment (20 mg/kg) and irradiation (5 Gy single fraction) directly to tumor, irradiation of 5 Gy directly to chest area, melatonin treatment (20 mg/kg) and radiation directly to chest, only melatonin treatment and whole-body scatter group (which gave radiation dose equal to the amount of radiation that the lung had received from the localized pelvic irradiation) to evaluate the effect of melatonin on the MDA level as well as SOD and GPx activity after 24 and 72 h of irradiation of 5 Gy single fraction directly to the tumor tissue and chest area, in the tumor tissue, the lung tissue, and the heart tissue. THE RESULTS: The results revealed that exposure to irradiation resulted in an increase in MDA level and suppressed SOD and GPx activity in the targeted and non-targeted lung and heart tissues, and the tumor tissue. Melatonin decreased MDA level in the lung and heart tissues. Also, melatonin improved SOD and GPx activity in non-targeted tissues, while it was able to reduce these two enzymes and decreased MDA level in the tumor tissue. CONCLUSION: Melatonin exhibited its ability to ameliorate oxidative stress in both targeted and non-targeted tissues. Administration of melatonin boosted SOD and GPx activity in the normal tissues, but not in the tumor cells. Through stimulation and suppression of the antioxidant system, Melatonin may cause sensitization of the tumor cells while protecting the normal tissues.
30172949|t|The main causes of death contributing to absolute and relative socio-economic inequality in Italy.
30172949|a|OBJECTIVES: Monitoring socio-economic inequality has become a priority for many governments, especially after the socio-economic changes that followed the 2008 financial crisis. This study aimed at detecting the causes of death with the largest socio-economic inequality in relative and absolute terms in Italy. STUDY DESIGN: This is a historical cohort study. METHODS: We used two regression-based measures of socio-economic inequality, the relative index of inequality (RII) and the slope index of inequality (SII), to rank the causes of death with the highest relative and absolute socio-economic inequality. We obtained these measures on a large census-based cohort study with more than 35 million individuals and 452,273 deaths registered in the period 2012-2014. RESULTS: The causes with the highest relative socio-economic inequality were the following: laryngeal cancer (RII: 6.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.8-7.78), AIDS/HIV (RII: 4.8, 95% CI: 3.1-7.4), chronic liver disease (RII: 4.8, 95% CI: 3.2-7.3), and chronic lower respiratory diseases (RII: 4.8, 95% CI: 3.5-6.5) in men, and diabetes (RII: 6.2, 95% CI: 4.8-7.9), AIDS/HIV (RII: 4.5, 95% CI: 2.7-7.7), genitourinary system (RII: 3.8, 95% CI: 2.6-5.4) and chronic liver diseases (RII: 3.6, 95% CI: 2.9-4.5) in women. In absolute terms, lung cancer and ischemic heart diseases contributed more to the overall socio-economic inequality in men, whereas diabetes and ischemic heart diseases accounted for most of the socio-economic inequality in women. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings call for effective policies to reduce the disparities in mortality from ischemic heart diseases, lung cancer, and diabetes taking into account the sex-specific pattern of inequality.
30170798|t|30-year trends in asthma and the trends in relation to hospitalization and mortality.
30170798|a|INTRODUCTION: The present study examines how trends in the prevalence of asthma during the past three decades associate with hospitalization and mortality during the same period. METHODS: Altogether 54   320 subjects aged 25-74 years were examined in seven independent cross-sectional population surveys repeated every five years between 1982 and 2012 in Finland. The study protocol included a standardized questionnaire on self-reported asthma, smoking habits and other risk factors, and clinical measurements at the study site. Data on hospitalizations were obtained from the Care Register for Health Care, and data on mortality from the National Causes of Death register. RESULTS: During the study, the prevalence of asthma increased - especially in women. In asthmatic compared with non-asthmatic subjects, hospitalization was significantly higher for all causes, respiratory causes, cardiovascular causes and lung cancer. In addition, particularly in asthmatic subjects, mean yearly hospital days in the 5-year periods after each survey diminished. In asthmatic subjects, the decrease in yearly all-cause hospital days was from 4.45 (between 1982 and 1987) to 1.11 (between 2012 and 2015) and in subjects without asthma the corresponding decrease was from 1.77 to 0.60 (p   <   0.001). Similarly between 1982 and 2015, COPD hospitalization decreased more in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic subjects. Generally in the present study, all-cause mortality decreased between 1982 and 2015, though mortality in asthmatic subjects compared with non-asthmatics was higher from all causes, respiratory causes and lung cancer. CONCLUSION: There was an increasing trend in the prevalence of asthma and a declining trend in hospitalization, especially in asthmatic subjects.

30170409|t|Hyper expression of MTBP may be an adverse signal for the survival of some malignant tumors: A data-based analysis and clinical observation.
30170409|a|To explore the relationship between mouse double minute 2 binding protein (MTBP) and the prognosis of cancer patients, a databank-based reanalysis was conducted and a clinical observation about lung adenocarcinoma was taken to verify the result of data analysis.We reanalyzed all the downloaded data in order to make a conclusion about the relationship between MTBP and the prognosis of cancer patients. At last, we collected 112 lung cancer patients with MTBP information to verify the results of data analysis (GSE30219).The overall Kaplan-Meier curve results of 6 eligible data groups were shown in Fig. 1. The Kaplan-Meier curve result of GSE16011 was shown in Fig. 1A (concordance index=59.48, Log-Rank Equal Curves [P=5.942e-05], R=0.045/1, risk groups hazard ratio=1.69 [conf. int. 1.3-2.9], P=7.344e-05), while the stratification results were displayed independently in Figs. 2 and 3. The similar results could be seen in other 5 data groups. The tissue sections of 112 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were collected and immunohistochemically stained. The hyper expression rate of MTBP in adenocarcinoma was 23.21% (26/112). The results showed that patients with hyper expression of MTBP had significantly worse prognosis than the control group, and the survival curves were clearly separated from each other (Fig. 4B, P=.000).Hyper expression of MTBP maybe an adverse event for the survival of some cancer patients, especially in glioblastoma, kidney cancer, and lung cancer patients, which has been verified in 112 lung cancer patients with MTBP status.

30169986|t|Early death in Danish stage I lung cancer patients: a population-based case study.
30169986|a|OBJECTIVE: Clinical stage (c-stage) at diagnosis is the most significant prognostic marker for patients with cancer, where 1- and 5-year survival rates as main landmarks when assessing outcomes. This is a population-based case study of Danish c-stage I lung cancer patients who were considered candidates for curative therapy and then died within 1  year after diagnosis (cases). Cases were identified in the Danish Lung Cancer Register (DLCR), and medical records were used to retrieve treatment details and cause of death (CoD). Our aims were, if possible, to identify and describe clusters of patients, in terms of CoD and treatment modality at risk for an adverse short-term outcome. RESULTS: Patients who died early were more frequently male, older, had squamous-cell histology, were less frequently surgically treated and generally had a higher burden of comorbidity. In terms of CoD, 29% died of lung cancer with distant recurrence (DR) as the most common type of recurrence (55%). Death from co-morbidity occurred for 23%, where the largest proportion (36%) died from another cancer. Nineteen percentage died from treatment complications, with the majority being male (p   <   .001). The remainder died of unknown or other causes. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer with DR remains the most common CoD. Identifying and accordingly treating patients at risk for DR could potentially improve outcomes. Further studies of the predominantly male subgroup of patients who die of treatment complications are needed. Death from co-morbidity especially in patients with another cancer is a significant CoD and when assessing the quality of lung cancer care a competing event.

30168824|t|Metal dyshomeostasis based biomarkers of lung cancer using human biofluids.
30168824|a|Lung cancer (LC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths in the world and it is well known that trace elements play important roles in the carcinogenic process activating and inhibiting enzymatic reactions and metalloproteins, in which they usually participate as cofactors. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 48 lung cancer patients and 39 controls (56 men and 31 women), aged 44-76 years between March 2011 and June 2012. Eleven elements have been included in the study: V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Mo, Cd, and Pb, some of them considered toxic (V, Cd, Cr and Pb), while others are essential (Co, Mo, Se, Fe and Zn), and they have been analyzed by ICP-QQQ-MS in serum, urine and for the first time in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In order to understand the involvement of metals in this process, an analytical metallomic approach based on non-denaturing precipitation of proteins (NDPP) has been optimized for the fractionation of high molecular mass (HMM) and low molecular mass (LMM) metal species, in order to distinguish between metal species that affect the biological activity and toxicological potential of the elements. In this work, the NDPP followed by the analysis of metals by ICP-QQQ-MS has been applied for the first time to serum, urine and BALF samples from lung cancer patients and controls in order to get metal-size molecule profiles (MSMP), which can be used as metal-based biomarkers of altered metabolic processes such as oxidative stress and homeostasis. In this sense, we have demonstrated that several metals are good biomarkers when they are related to labile complexes, complexed with low molecular mass ligands, or in the form of metalloproteins (i.e. V and Cr in HMM and Cu in LMM), which has been described for the first time. On the other hand, metal dyshomeostasis biomarkers are proposed using metal ratios and correlations. Finally, the ratios between elements were shown to be important biomarkers for lung cancer in serum (V/Mn, V/Pb, V/Zn, Cr/Pb), urine (Cr/Cd, Mn/Cd, V/Cd, Co/Cd, Cd/Pb) and BALF (V/Cu), which reflects the dyshomeostasis of metals in lung cancer. In this sense, several metals are correlated to others suggesting also the existence of an interconnected homeostasis in lung cancer.
