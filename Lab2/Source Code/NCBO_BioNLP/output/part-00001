30168024|t|Understanding the evolving phenotype of vascular complications in telomere biology disorders.
30168024|a|Vascular complications such as bleeding due to gastrointestinal telangiectatic anomalies, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, hepatopulmonary syndrome, and retinal vessel abnormalities are being reported in patients with telomere biology disorders (TBDs) more frequently than previously described. The international clinical care consortium of telomere-associated ailments and family support group Dyskeratosis Congenita Outreach, Inc. held a workshop on vascular abnormalities in the TBDs at the National Cancer Institute in October 2017. Clinicians and basic scientists reviewed current data on vascular complications, hypotheses for the underlying biology and developed new collaborations to address the etiology and clinical management of vascular complications in TBDs.

30168011|t|Advanced imaging in pulmonary hypertension: emerging techniques and applications.
30168011|a|Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a pathophysiological disorder defined by an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure which can occur in multiple clinical conditions. Irrespective of etiology, PH entails a negative impact on exercise capacity and quality of life, and is associated with high mortality particularly in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Noninvasive imaging techniques play an important role in suggesting the presence of PH, providing noninvasive pulmonary pressure measurements, classifying the group of PH, identifying a possibly underlying disease, providing prognostic information and assessing response to treatment. While echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) and ventilation/perfusion scans are an integral part of routine work-up of patients with suspected PH according to current guidelines and across centers, innovative new techniques and applications in the field of PH such as 3D echocardiography, dual-energy CT, 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), T1 and extracellular volume fraction mapping, non-contrast-enhanced MRI sequences for perfusion and ventilation assessment, and molecular-targeted positron emission tomography are emerging. This review discusses advanced and emerging imaging techniques in diagnosis, prognostic evaluation and follow-up of patients with PH.

30166526|t|Identification of a novel anoikis signalling pathway using the fungal virulence factor gliotoxin.
30166526|a|Anoikis is a form of apoptosis induced by cell detachment. Integrin inactivation plays a major role in the process but the exact signalling pathway is ill-defined. Here we identify an anoikis pathway using gliotoxin (GT), a virulence factor of the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, which causes invasive aspergillosis in humans. GT prevents integrin binding to RGD-containing extracellular matrix components by covalently modifying cysteines in the binding pocket. As a consequence, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is inhibited resulting in dephosphorylation of p190RhoGAP, allowing activation of RhoA. Sequential activation of ROCK, MKK4/MKK7 and JNK then triggers pro-apoptotic phosphorylation of Bim. Cells in suspension or lacking integrin surface expression are insensitive to GT but are sensitised to ROCK-MKK4/MKK7-JNK-dependent anoikis upon attachment to fibronectin or integrin upregulation. The same signalling pathway is triggered by FAK inhibition or inhibiting integrin aV/b3 with Cilengitide. Thus, GT can target integrins to induce anoikis on lung epithelial cells.
